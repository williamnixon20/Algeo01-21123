## How to run
1. Go to src/main/Main.java
2. Click run (top right) if you are in VSCode. It's already setup so that it will automatically build (make files in bin) and run.
3. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vY5eNw5OdE (15:00 - end)
4. Not in VSCode? Go to your root directory, and type "java -cp bin main.Main" to run the compiled class.

Note: How to compile without vscode??
